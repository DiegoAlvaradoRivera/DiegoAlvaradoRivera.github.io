# Hi, I am Diego Alvarado

I am a student of Information Engineering at Pacifico University, Peru.
My principal area of interest is data engineering. 
My abilities include Python and Scala programming, distributed computing with Spark, 
Power BI and services of the Azure Data Platform (SQL Database, Databricks, Data Factory).


## Achievements

- **Third place in Latin America at the DataJam Pasos Libres 2020 (LawIT team)**: 
This competition had the goal of developing solutions to face human trafficking. 
To this end, a predictive model was developed to forecast the number of reported 
human trafficking cases in each of the peruvian regions for each year taking as 
inputs a number of socioeconomic indicators.

## Online Education

- **Functional Programming in Scala (June 16, 2020)**: This Coursera specialization begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm and then builds up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. It also explores parallel programming on multicore architectures and distibuted programming on a cluster using Apache Spark.
